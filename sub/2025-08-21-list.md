# Window System TODO

| Task | Notes | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Avoid including `windows.h` in headers | Use a small header with forward declarations for the WinAPI types we actually need | Done |
| Create a base class `Wnd` | All window types will inherit from this class | In progress |
| Keep the design simple | The code should be easy to read and understand for anyone new | Planned |
| Separate app logic from window objects | The application manages windows, but doesnâ€™t live inside them | Planned |
| Message handling | Start with one global `WndDefaultProc`, later give each window its own local proc | Planned |
